# Simple-First-Game
The first game I created by using pygame

I tried to use python to build something, therefore I built this simple game. It may has terrible graphics and animations, but hope you enjoy it.
You may wonder why this game does not has a win condition. It is kind of planned to see how long you can sustain on playing it. 
As long as you feel like you are enough for this, then you can quite the game.
